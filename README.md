DellEMC OpenManage Python SDK (OMSDK) is a python library that helps developers and customers to automate the lifecycle management of PowerEdge Servers. OMSDK module leverages the iDRAC's REST APIs based on [DMTF Redfish standards](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish) as well as [WS-Man](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/ws-man) and SNMP protocols for configuration, deployment, updates and monitoring of PowerEdge Servers.  In addition, OMSDK also supports monitoring and querying inventory information for PowerEdge Modular Infrastructure (M1000e, VRTX and FX2).
